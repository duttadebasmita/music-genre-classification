    Welcome to the Music Genre Classification System! üéµüîç

    Our mission is to help you identify music genres efficiently. Upload an audio file, and our system will analyze it to detect the genre. Let's explore the world of music together!

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Audio:** Go to the **Genre Classification** page and upload an audio file.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the audio using advanced algorithms to identify the genre.
    3. **Results:** View the results and enjoy discovering the genre of your music.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate genre detection.
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for a seamless user experience.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Genre Classification** page in the sidebar to upload an audio file and experience the power of our Music Genre Classification System!

    ### About Us
    Learn more about the project, our team, and our goals on the **About** page.
